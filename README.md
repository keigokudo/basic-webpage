# React Atomic Design Boilerplate

I scribbled a boilerplate with the methodology [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) using cool things, like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [styled-compnents](https://styled-components.com/) and [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons).
